# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple Java program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess the number. The program gives hints on whether the user's guess is too high or too low, and uses a binary search algorithm to find a match. The program also keeps track of the previous guesses and prevents the user from guessing the same number twice.
